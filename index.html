      <p>In a large saucepan, cook the bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon, crumble, and set aside to use as a topping for the peas. Saute the onion in the bacon drippings until tender. Add the peas, diced tomatoes and green chiles, salt, chili powder, pepper and water. Cover and cook over medium heat for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the peas are tender. Add additional water, if necessary. Serve garnished with crumbled bacon.

      <h2>Greens radish arugula</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="recipie">
      <p>In a small bowl, whisk together the 2 tablespoons of finely grated Pecorino, lemon juice, a couple pinches of salt and a few grinds of pepper if you're using it. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil, whisking constantly. Taste for seasoning and set aside. Slice the radishes into thin rounds. You should have about 1 cup. In a serving bowl, combine the radishes, arugula, 3 tablespoons coarsely grated Pecorino and about two thirds of the dressing. Toss well, taste, and add more dressing if needed. Serve right away, before the radishes and arugula start to wilt!</p>
